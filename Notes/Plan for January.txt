Plan for January:

- Investigate why increasing the number of orthogonal polynomials when solving LE causes problems (test for a small domain such as [0,5]

- Find out why there is worse convergence on a wide domain for trigonometric basis despite getting a lower residual error on small domains

- Meet someone who studies functional analysis at Durham to talk about the step used in
